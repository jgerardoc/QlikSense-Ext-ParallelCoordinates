*********************************
Installation & Use
*********************************
To install, copy all files to folder "C:\Users\(your user name)\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\ParallelCoordinates".

To use, just drag the "Parallel Coordinates" object from the object menu on the left in Edit mode.

Given the nature of the visualization, it uses one dimension and maximum 9 measures.

You can make selections on every axis, and drag any axis to left or right to reorder.
